        <!-- The tool description should answer these kinds of questions:
            What is the tool itself is used for in the development
            process? Who would use this tool? What is the general use-case or
            problem that this tool solves? Look at the tool's documentation or
            website(s) to get their own descriptions. Look at Wikipedia or other
            outside websites. If there is a Hudson plugin, read their
            documentation for ideas, examples, etc. It's OK to copy word-for-word
            only if appropriate, such as FOSS - but not commercial software.
            -->
        <p>Gerrit is a web based code review system, facilitating online
        code reviews for projects using the Git version control system.
        It provides a systematic process for evaluating and approving
        source code changes before they are committed. Gerrit provides
        facilities to park changes until they are approved by
        appropriate engineers. Engineers are notified of a change
        (or they sign into the Gerrit server to find new changes)
        and must decide if the change should be accepted into the
        code base. This process is typically implemented by manual
        code review and/or pulling changes into a local workspace,
        building the changes, and running some tests.</p>

        <h2>ElectricCommander Integration to Gerrit</h2>
        <!-- The integration description should answer the questions:
            How deep does our integration go? Why should I care? What general
            functionality does the plugin include? What functionality does
            the plugin omit?
            -->

        <p>The ElectricCommander Gerrit plugin simplifies the
        build/test approval process. The goal is to run tests
        automatically before the reviewer looks at the change,
        although a setting is available to run builds on demand
        only. The Android team published a
        <a href="http://source.android.com/submit-patches/workflow">
        diagram</a> that describes the workflow for submitting
        changes (see link). Note the step after "A" titled
        "Verifier patches the commit to their local client, then
        builds and tests the change". This is the step
        ElectricCommander automates for you. The plugin works
        closely with Gerrit by adding links to run builds and to
        finished builds directly in Gerrit change comments. Also,
        ElectricCommander can act as a reviewer by automatically
        setting a Gerrit category to a value based on the build
        success or failure. The plugin communicates with the Gerrit
        server to retrieve information about the change, including
        the commands used to pull down files in a patch set. First,
        a full repository is initialized to the head of a specified
        branch. Second, changes submitted to Gerrit
        (adds/deletes/modifies) are overlaid. Third, a build you
        create is run. This build can do whatever you need from
        running a simple "make" to running complicated automatic
        test suites involving physical hardware. You decide what
        determines test success or failure and ElectricCommander
        annotates Gerrit with your build results.</p>

        <h2>Integrated Version</h2>

        <p>This plugin was tested with Gerrit v2.8.5.</p>

        <h2 id="gerrit-setup">Setup</h2>
        <p>The following steps should be followed to setup Gerrit for use with the ElectricCommander Gerrit plugin.
            <ol>
                <li>Add the repo tool to the PATH environment variable for the resource where the plugin will run.
                    If the path cannot be updated for the resource, then update the plugin property "pseudo_code/repo_cmd"
                    to point to the repo tool. The ElectricCommander Gerrit plugin uses the Repo tool for syncing to the Git repositories and
                    downloading changes from the repositories.</li>
                <li>Grant 'Access Database' capability to the Gerrit user configured for the plugin to communicate with the Gerrit server.
                    Since Gerrit v2.6, by default Gerrit administrators no longer have the 'Access Database' capability.
                    This capability is required by the plugin to access the Gerrit database using the gsql command.</li>
                <li id="gerrit-verified-label">
                    Setup the 'Verified' review label in Gerrit for use with the plugin by following the steps below.
                    Starting with Gerrit version 2.6, the 'Verified' label is no longer installed by default.
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>
                            Follow the steps documented <a href="https://gerrit-documentation.storage.googleapis.com/Documentation/2.8.5/config-labels.html#label_Verified">here</a>
                            to install the 'Verified' review label in Gerrit.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Re-start the Gerrit server for the changes to take effect.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Grant 'Label Verified' capability on 'refs/heads/*' to the Gerrit user configured for the plugin to communicate with the Gerrit server.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <div class="sectionnote">
                Plugin configurations are sets of parameters that
                apply across some or all of the plugin's
                procedures. They are intended to reduce repetition
                of common values, create predefined sets of
                parameters for end users, and to securely store
                credentials where needed. Each configuration is
                given a unique name that is entered in designated
                parameters on procedures that use them.<br />
                 Plugin configurations are created by going to the
                ElectricCommander "Administration" tab, then to
                the "Plugins" sub-tab. On the right side of the
                line for the specific plugin, there is a
                "Configure" link which will open the Configuration
                page.

            <p>You can create one or more Gerrit plugin
            configurations to specify how you want the plugin to
            work. To manage your Gerrit plugin configurations, go
            to the Administration | Plugins page and select the
            "Configure" link to the right of the EC-Gerrit plugin.
            This link provides a list of configurations with menu
            options to edit/delete existing configurations.</p>

            <h4>IMPORTANT NOTES:</h4>

            <p><b>Creating ElectricCommander Resources:</b> create
            one or more ElectricCommander resources where your
            builds will run. Group these resources in one or more
            pools. Later, when you create the Gerrit plugin
            configuration, you can specify a pool name for the
            resources to use. Also, set the special property
            "gerrit_working_dir" on each resource. The value of
            this property is the directory where you want to put
            build sources. This directory can be relative to the
            current directory (which is the normal
            ElectricCommander workspace created for the build) or
            absolute. When the plugin runs, it checks if the
            directory exists. If the directory is found,
            ElectricCommander assumes there is a repository and
            only syncs changes. If the directory is not found, the
            plugin creates one and does a full init and sync of the
            repository. Because this process can be time consuming,
            the plugin also supports using cached directories. You
            can setup one or more locations where builds can be
            run. Directory contents are not deleted after a build
            so the plugin only needs to reset and sync to the head
            of the branch at the start of each build. Assuming you
            build the same branch many times, each reset and sync
            will run much faster than a full init and sync. Changes
            are applied as before.</p>
			
            <p>Here is an example of how to create the resource.</p>
			<p>First, navigate to the "Cloud" tab in the ElectricCommander. Here you can create the resource to use with the Gerrit tool, or edit an existing one:</p><img src="../../plugins/EC-Gerrit/images/Resource/EC-Gerrit_Resource1.png" />
			<p>Then, provide the parameters for the creation of the Resource. Now, to add the "gerrit_working_dir" required property, navigate to "Create Property" in the "Custom Resource Properties":</p><img src="../../plugins/EC-Gerrit/images/Resource/EC-Gerrit_Resource2.png" />
			<p>Provide the name of the property, in our case must be called "gerrit_working_dir", and provide the value:</p><img src="../../plugins/EC-Gerrit/images/Resource/EC-Gerrit_Resource3.png" />
             
			
            <p><b>Customizations to Schedule:</b> the plugin scans
            your Gerrit server for changes every 15 minutes. This
            is an ElectricCommander schedule. If you want to change
            the frequency, modify the "Gerrit New Change Scanner"
            schedule, which you can find under the "Administration"
            tab, navigate to "Plugins", select the "EC-Gerrit" plugin
            and then navigate to the "Schedules" tab.</p>

            <p><b>Changing the resource for procedures:</b> the
            resource for some procedures is set to local for your
            convenience. However, if you need to change the
            resource, take these steps: click the procedure to see
            its details, then click Edit, and change the Default
            Resource to suit your needs.</p>

            <p>Team builds are designed for the build and release
            team. These builds combine changes of one or more
            patchsets to test how multiple changes will work
            together. The plugin finds patchsets based on rules
            provided in the configuration "Team Build Rules"
            property. The plugin does not run team builds
            automatically. You must run team build procedures from
            ElectricCommander.</p>

            <p>The TeamBuildCleanup mark the changes as approved if

            directly, which provides additional flexibility.</p>

            the gerrit server and which were scanned previously,

        <h1>Release Notes</h1>

        <h2>EC-Gerrit-2.1.0</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Added support for Gerrit v2.8.5</li>
            <li>Updated plugin logic to support Gerrit review labels 'Code-Review' and 'Verified'.
                Starting with Gerrit version 2.6, the 'Verified' label is no longer installed by default.
                Please follow the steps documented <a href="#gerrit-verified-label">here</a> to install the
                label for use with ElectricCommander.</li>
            <li>Updated the plugin logic to handle user names specified in build rule filters.</li>
            <li>Allowed the 'Repository Server' configuration parameter to optionally accept the protocol it
                uses for data transfer as part of the parameter value. So now, the 'Repository Server'
                value can now be set as "ssh://my_gerrit_server.my_domain.com" if "my_gerrit_server.my_domain.com"
                is using Secure Shell. In order to maintain backward-compatibility, if the value is specified
                without any protocol as "my_gerrit_server.my_domain.com", 'git' will be assumed to be the protocol
                being used by default.</li>
            <li>Deprecated 'SetupGerritServer' procedure. This procedure is no longer supported with Gerrit version 2.6
                and above. Please follow the steps documented <a href="#gerrit-setup">here</a> to help setup Gerrit for
                use with ElectricCommander.</li>
            <li>Added a 'revert' step to 'DevBuildCleanup' and 'TeamBuildCleanup' procedures to revert any uncommitted
                changes from the working directory as part of the cleanup.</li>
            <li>Added 'postProcessor's to track the progress of the plugin procedures.</li>
